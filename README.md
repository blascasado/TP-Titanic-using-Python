# TP-Titanic-using-Python
Final Project of Industry 4.0 course @UBA as part of my Engineering degree

You my find attached the python code script (https://github.com/blascasado/TP-Titanic-using-Python/blob/main/Tp1-definitivo%20para%20entregar.ipynb), the input csv. (https://github.com/blascasado/TP-Titanic-using-Python/blob/main/train%20(1).csv), the project instructions and the final document (https://github.com/blascasado/TP-Titanic-using-Python/blob/main/informe%20tp1.pdf)

The aim of the project was to predict the survivors to the Tictanic event based on the list of the passegers and their attributes by exploring which variables influenced more in the decision.
